# Summary

This piece is a simple n-sided ring intended for outward facing cameras. The default is 7-sided, but changes may be made to the OpenSCAD parameters to change the number of cams, depending on use case and lens used. 7-cams is based on assumption of using "Official Raspberry Pi HQ Camera Lens - Wide Angle". In theory, one could create a 360 panorama from 6 of these lenses, but in practice, a bit of overlap is more forgiving.
